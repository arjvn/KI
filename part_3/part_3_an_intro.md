# What is TensorRT?

TensorRT is a high-performance deep learning inference library developed by NVIDIA. It is used to optimize neural network models specifically for NVIDIA GPUs, improving inference speed and efficiency dramatically. TensorRT achieves this through several methods:

1. Layer and Tensor Fusion: Combining multiple layers and tensors into a single operation to reduce the overhead caused by memory access and kernel launches.

2. Precision Calibration: Supporting mixed precision (combining different types of computation precision) to increase performance while maintaining accuracy. For example, using FP16 and INT8 precision where appropriate.

3. Kernel Auto-Tuning: Selecting the best kernels for GPU operations based on the specific architecture of the GPU in use.

4. Dynamic Tensor Memory: Optimizing memory usage to increase memory bandwidth and reduce latency.

## Why use TensorRT?

The primary reasons for using TensorRT include:

1. Increased Inference Speed: Significant reduction in latency, which is crucial for real-time applications like autonomous vehicles, video processing, and interactive applications.

2. Efficiency at Scale: Reduced resource consumption and better utilization of GPU hardware, which is crucial for deploying deep learning models in production where cost and resource efficiency are important.

3. Support for High Throughput: Optimizing batched operations to handle multiple inputs simultaneously, which is essential for high-throughput applications like processing web requests or video frames.

## Setting a Batch Number

In TensorRT, specifying a batch size explicitly or managing it dynamically is crucial due to the following reasons:

1. Batch Size Optimization: Different batch sizes can be optimized differently depending on the GPU architecture and the specific model. TensorRT can tune the model to operate most efficiently for a given batch size.

2. Dynamic Shape Support: Modern applications often require dynamic input sizes (e.g., different image sizes, variable input dimensions). Setting the batch number or using dynamic shapes allows TensorRT to handle varying input sizes at runtime.

## Is the Output Created from TensorRT GPU-Specific?

The output from TensorRT, in the form of an optimized inference engine, is GPU-specific. This means:

1. GPU-Specific Optimizations: The optimizations made by TensorRT are tailored to the specific GPU architecture on which the model is compiled. This includes using specific CUDA cores efficiently, memory bandwidth optimizations, and more.

2. Portability: While the TensorRT engine is portable across similar NVIDIA GPUs, an engine optimized on one class of GPUs (e.g., Tesla) might not perform optimally on a different class (e.g., GeForce) due to differences in GPU architecture.

3. Re-compilation Required: If you need to deploy the same model on a different GPU architecture, it's recommended to re-optimize the model on that specific architecture using TensorRT to ensure optimal performance.

## Conclusion

TensorRT is essential for deploying deep learning models on NVIDIA GPUs, especially in scenarios requiring the highest efficiency and speed for inference. Its ability to optimize models specifically for the hardware it will run on makes it a critical tool in the deployment pipeline for deep learning applications.
