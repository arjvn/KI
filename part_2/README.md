## READ ME IS YET TO BE UPDATED


FOR SAM

Entry point to code is: part_2_cifar.py
Interactive report:  https://wandb.ai/arjvn/SimpleCNN/sweeps/bkx8n4t2?nw=nwuserarjvn

let me know if you cant access it - pdf print: part_2/bayes_hyperparameter_opt_cnn.pdf

I would recommend looking at the part_2/sweep_config.json to start with.
